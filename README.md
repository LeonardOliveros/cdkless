> The simplest way to build serverless microservices with AWS CDK

CdkLess dramatically simplifies the development of serverless microservices on AWS by providing a clean, intuitive API that abstracts away the complexities of the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Beta Status

**CdkLess is currently in beta.** While it's functional and usable, please be aware of the following:

- The API may change without following strict semantic versioning until v1.0
- Some features are still in development
- Documentation might be incomplete in some areas
- Use in production environments at your own risk
- We welcome feedback, bug reports, and contributions to help stabilize the library

We're actively working to reach a stable 1.0 release and appreciate your understanding and support during this beta phase.

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
npm install cdkless aws-cdk-lib constructs
```

## üéØ Why CdkLess?

CdkLess was created for development teams that need to:
- Build and deploy microservices quickly without deep AWS expertise
- Maintain consistent infrastructure patterns across multiple services
- Focus on business logic rather than infrastructure code
- Follow best practices without having to reinvent them each time

## üìä Comparison with Standard CDK

| Standard CDK | CdkLess |
|--------------|---------|
| ~200 lines of code | ~15 lines of code |
| 4+ files per service | 1 file per service |
| Steep learning curve | Minutes to learn |
| Complex to maintain | Simple maintenance |
| Requires deep AWS knowledge | Minimal AWS knowledge required |

## üìã Quick Start

Create a fully functional serverless microservice in **just one file**:

```typescript
// src/app.ts
import { CdkLess } from 'cdkless';

class MyMicroservice extends CdkLess {
  constructor() {
    super('user-service');
    
    // Create a Lambda function with a GET endpoint
    this.lambda('src/handlers/users/get-users')
      .get('/users');
      
    // Create a Lambda function with a POST endpoint and environment variables
    this.lambda('src/handlers/users/create-user')
      .post('/users')
      .environment({
        TABLE_NAME: 'users-table',
        STAGE: this.stage
      });
  }
}

// That's it! Just instantiate your microservice
new MyMicroservice();
```

## üèõÔ∏è Architectural Approach

CdkLess follows a specific architectural pattern:

- **Infrastructure Separation**: The library is designed with the convention that infrastructure (databases, queues, topics, etc.) is managed in a separate CDK project. This separation of concerns allows infrastructure teams to maintain core resources independently.

- **Service Integration**: CdkLess focuses specifically on mounting API Gateway endpoints, Lambda functions, and their triggers by importing existing resources via ARNs. This approach encourages a clean separation between infrastructure and application code.

- **ARN-Based Integration**: Instead of creating infrastructure resources directly, CdkLess connects to existing resources using their ARNs. This pattern promotes infrastructure reuse and better governance of cloud resources.

```typescript
// Example of connecting to existing infrastructure via ARNs
this.lambda('src/handlers/orders/process')
  .post('/orders')
  .addTablePermissions('arn:aws:dynamodb:region:account:table/orders-table')  // Connect to existing DynamoDB table
  .addSnsTrigger('arn:aws:sns:region:account:topic/order-events')  // Connect to existing SNS topic
```

## üîç Key Features

### üåê API Gateway Integration

Create HTTP API endpoints with a fluent interface:

```typescript
// GET endpoint
this.lambda('src/handlers/products/get-product')
  .get('/products/:id');

// POST endpoint
this.lambda('src/handlers/products/create-product')
  .post('/products');

// PUT endpoint
this.lambda('src/handlers/products/update-product')
  .put('/products/:id');

// DELETE endpoint
this.lambda('src/handlers/products/delete-product')
  .delete('/products/:id');
```

### üîê API Authorization

Secure your endpoints with various types of authorizers:

```typescript
import { HttpJwtAuthorizer, HttpLambdaAuthorizer } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-apigatewayv2-authorizers';
import { Function } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda';

// Creating a Lambda authorizer
const authorizerFunction = new Function(this, 'AuthorizerFunction', {
  // function configuration
});

const lambdaAuthorizer = new HttpLambdaAuthorizer(
  'my-lambda-authorizer',
  authorizerFunction,
  {
    authorizerName: 'my-lambda-authorizer',
    identitySource: ['$request.header.Authorization']
  }
);

// Creating a JWT authorizer
const jwtAuthorizer = new HttpJwtAuthorizer(
  'my-jwt-authorizer',
  'https://cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/us-east-1_XXXXXXXXX',
  {
    jwtAudience: ['my-app-client-id']
  }
);

// Securing routes with authorizers
this.lambda('src/handlers/admin/dashboard')
  .get('/admin/dashboard')
  .addAuthorizer(lambdaAuthorizer);

this.lambda('src/handlers/users/profile')
  .get('/users/profile')
  .addAuthorizer(jwtAuthorizer, ['profile:read']);
```

### üìä Database Integration

Connect to DynamoDB tables using ARNs:

```typescript
this.lambda('src/handlers/orders/create-order')
  .post('/orders')
  .addTablePermissions('arn:aws:dynamodb:region:account:table/orders-table');
```

### üì® Event-Driven Architecture

Create event-driven microservices with SQS, SNS, and S3 triggers:

```typescript
// SQS Queue consumer
this.lambda('src/handlers/orders/process-order')
  .addSqsTrigger('arn:aws:sqs:region:account:queue/orders-queue');

// SNS Topic subscriber
this.lambda('src/handlers/notifications/send-email')
  .addSnsTrigger('arn:aws:sns:region:account:topic/notifications-topic');

// S3 event handler
this.lambda('src/handlers/documents/process-upload')
  .addS3Trigger('arn:aws:s3:region:account:bucket/documents-bucket');
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Configuration

Add environment variables to your Lambda functions:

```typescript
this.lambda('src/handlers/payment/process')
  .post('/payments')
  .environment({
    PAYMENT_API_KEY: 'secret-key',
    STAGE: this.stage,
    LOG_LEVEL: 'INFO'
  });
```

By default, CdkLess uses the `STAGE` environment variable to determine the deployment stage (e.g., 'dev', 'staging', 'prod'). If not set, it defaults to 'dev'.

## üèóÔ∏è Microservice Architecture Best Practices

CdkLess encourages microservice best practices:

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle

Each Lambda function should handle a specific task. For example:

```typescript
// User service
this.lambda('src/handlers/users/get-user').get('/users/:id');
this.lambda('src/handlers/users/create-user').post('/users');
this.lambda('src/handlers/users/update-user').put('/users/:id');
this.lambda('src/handlers/users/delete-user').delete('/users/:id');

// Order service
this.lambda('src/handlers/orders/get-order').get('/orders/:id');
this.lambda('src/handlers/orders/create-order').post('/orders');
```

### 2. Domain-Driven Design

Organize your handlers by domain:

```
src/
  handlers/
    users/
      get-user.ts
      create-user.ts
    orders/
      get-order.ts
      create-order.ts
    payments/
      process-payment.ts
```

### 3. Shared Resources

Resources are shared automatically. For example, all HTTP endpoints will share a single API Gateway.

## üåü Core Principles

CdkLess is built on these core principles:

1. **Everything in One Place**: Define, configure, and deploy from a single file
2. **Fluent API**: Chain methods for intuitive Lambda configuration
3. **Convention Over Configuration**: Sensible defaults for everything
4. **Automatic Building**: No need to call `.build()` or `.synth()`
5. **Minimal Magic**: No hidden configuration
6. **Encapsulated Dependencies**: The framework handles all CDK dependencies

## ü§î FAQ

### How does CdkLess compare to other frameworks like Serverless Framework?

CdkLess builds directly on top of AWS CDK, giving you the full power of CDK with a simplified interface. Unlike configuration-based frameworks, CdkLess uses a code-first approach, which provides greater flexibility and type safety.

### Can I access the underlying CDK constructs?

Yes, CdkLess doesn't hide the underlying CDK. You can always access the shared API or other resources.

### How does deployment work?

CdkLess handles the CDK synthesis process automatically when your application runs. Just execute your application with `npm start` and it will deploy to AWS.

### What does the beta status mean for my project?

During the beta phase, we recommend using CdkLess for non-critical projects, proofs of concept, or in environments where you can tolerate potential API changes. We're working hard to stabilize the API for a 1.0 release, but until then, you should expect possible breaking changes between minor versions. We recommend pinning to exact versions in your package.json during the beta period.
